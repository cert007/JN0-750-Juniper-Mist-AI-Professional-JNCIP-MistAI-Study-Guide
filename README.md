## Detailed Breakdown of JN0-750 Exam Objectives

The JN0-750 blueprint is structured around five pivotal domains, each weighted to reflect their criticality in Mist AI mastery. These objectives draw from Juniper's official training resources and emphasize hands-on automation over theoretical concepts. Below is a closer look at each:

### 1. Juniper Mist Distributed Enterprise Networks Solutions

This foundational objective explores the architecture of Mist AI in multi-site environments. Expect questions on site federation, virtual networks, and integration with Juniper's broader ecosystem, including EX Series switches and SRX firewalls. Key skills include designing scalable topologies that support zero-touch provisioning and AI-driven service levels (SLEs) for metrics like throughput and coverage.

### 2. Juniper Mist Automation Strategies

Here, the exam probes strategic approaches to automation, such as leveraging APIs, webhooks, and the Mist Cloud for programmatic control. Candidates must demonstrate proficiency in tools like Ansible, Python scripting, and Mist's RESTful APIs to streamline device onboarding and policy enforcement across hybrid clouds.

### 3. Juniper Mist Security Solutions

Security is paramount in distributed networks, and this section covers AI-enhanced threat detection, including micro-segmentation, encrypted traffic analysis, and integration with Juniper's ATP Cloud. Topics span from configuring virtual chassis security to responding to anomalies via Marvis, Juniper's virtual network assistant.

### 4. Automating Day 1 Operations

Day 1 focuses on initial deployment and validation. Objectives include automating switch and AP provisioning, template-based configurations, and inventory management. Mastery here ensures seamless rollouts, minimizing human error in brownfield or greenfield scenarios.

### 5. Automating Day 2 Operations

Building on Day 1, this domain addresses ongoing management: firmware upgrades, performance baselining, and change management. Questions often simulate troubleshooting workflows, where AI insights guide root-cause analysis and proactive optimizations.

These objectives are interconnected, with approximately 20-25% of questions per domain, encouraging a holistic study approach.

## Strategic Study Plan: From Foundation to Exam-Ready Confidence

Preparation should follow a structured, practical approach:

1. **Start with the basics** – Revisit your JNCIS-MistAI knowledge to refresh core principles.
2. **Use official and third-party materials** – Combine Juniper’s Mist AI Professional course with Cert007’s detailed study guide for real-world alignment.
3. **Practice actively** – Simulate real exams using NWExam or similar tools, focusing on time management and comprehension.
4. **Hands-on learning** – Use Mist’s sandbox or lab simulators to apply automation scripts and experiment with network templates.
5. **Engage with the community** – Join forums such as r/Juniper and official Juniper groups to gain insights from peers and recent test-takers.
